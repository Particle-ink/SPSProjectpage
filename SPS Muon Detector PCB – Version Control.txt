SPS Muon Detector PCB â€“ Version Control System
Versioning Scheme

Major Version (X.0)
Indicates a fundamental change in design or architecture.
Examples:

Switching to a new FPGA or microcontroller.

Redesigning the power distribution network.

Adding/removing entire subsystems (e.g., timing circuit, DAQ interface).

Minor Version (X.Y)
Indicates incremental updates that affect the circuit but do not change its fundamental design.
Examples:

Changing trace width for thermal/current considerations.

Updating footprints for manufacturability.

Replacing an obsolete component with a pin-compatible alternative.

Patch Version (X.Y.Z) (optional, but useful for PCBs)
Indicates very small fixes that do not affect circuit function.
Examples:

Correcting silkscreen text.

Moving fiducials or mounting holes.

Adjusting board outline without touching circuitry.




start
-----------

v1.0.0
built initial board

v1.1.0
added holes to board and spaced them according to Engineering lead

v2.1.0
moved over to std version of easyeda from pro

v2.1.1
added clarification to text fields and added silk screen explanation along with a logo

v2.2.1
realized i was using wrong schematic and updated base schematic then switch some parts out for higher volt ones

v2.2.2
changed logo on board by inverting it and moved it

v2.3.2
changed one of the bnc connectors to dc power(i read it wrong origonaly it always should have been this way)
